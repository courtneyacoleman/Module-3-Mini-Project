# Module-3-Mini-Challenge
  Rock, paper, scissors.

##  Description
This is a game application that allows the user to play rock, paper, scissors against the computer's randomly generated choice. The wins, losses, and ties are stored on the scorecard on the homepage. 

##Deployment
This application is deployed through Github pages and can be found at:
https://courtneyacoleman.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/

## Instructions

User opens the application and sees the current date and time displayed at the top of the header.  Under the heading are schedule blocks for all of the hours of their typical working day.  Meetings, events, and tasks can be entered and saved to local storage so that they persist when the page is refreshed.  As the day progresses the user is able to easily tell which tasks are past, current, or future.  The past blocks become grey, current hour block will be red, and future hours are displayed in green.

# Future project improvements

I would like the color coding to update without having to refresh the page. I was unable to get the icon to work properly through font awesome.
