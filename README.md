# Module-3-Mini-Challenge
  Rock, paper, scissors.

##  Description
This is a game application that allows the user to play rock, paper, scissors against the computer's randomly generated choice. The wins, losses, and ties are stored on the scorecard on the homepage. 

##Deployment
This application is deployed through Github pages and can be found here:
https://courtneyacoleman.github.io/Module-3-Mini-Project/

## Instructions
When the user opens the page they are presented with the scorecard and the button to "shoot". When they press shoot a new round of the game begins through pop-up boxes.  The first box allows them to make their choice by enter R, P, or S indicating "rock, paper, or scissors."  They are able to enter a capital or lowercase letter and the game will be able to use either respone.  If they enter something other than r, p, or s they will be presented with an alert that says "Choose a valid weapon." and be taken back to the starting page.  If the user chose a valid weapon a popup will tell them which weapon the computer chose.  Followed by another telling them if they won.  The scorecard will be updated.

# Future project improvements

I would like to run the game without using as many popup boxes. One idea I have is to make seperate rock, paper, and scissor buttons and have the player choose through those.  I would also like to add images or a gif to the mainpage.
